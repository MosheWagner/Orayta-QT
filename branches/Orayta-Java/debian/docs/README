# Installing from source:

To compile and install under linux, run from project's root dir:
$ qmake
$ make
And then as root:
# make install

This should compile the program, and install it system-wide.

( Qt development libraries are required. The are usually under the packages 'qtbase5-dev' and 'libqt5webkit5-devel'.
the folowing packages are also requiered: 'libfribidi-dev' and 'libpoppler-qt4-dev'.
some packages are required for any installation of a c++ source program, and they are probbably alredy installed on your system. these are:
'make' and 'g++' ).

If the books were downaloaded seperatly, you should run (as root) in their folder:
# make install

Or unpack them into this folder before installing the program.
